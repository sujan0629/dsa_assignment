# DSA Assignment 2

This repository contains solutions for Assignment #2 in Data Structure and Algorithms (COMP202).

## Tasks

1. **prog_1.c**: Check if a mathematical expression has balanced parentheses using a stack.
2. **prog_2.c**: Convert infix expression to postfix and evaluate it.
3. **prog_3.c**: Implement reverse traversal in a linked list.
4. **prog_4.c**: Implement doubly linked list with insert and delete operations.
5. **prog_5.c**: Implement undirected graph using adjacency matrix with BFS and DFS traversal.
6. **prog_6.c**: Build min and max heaps from an unsorted array.
7. **prog_7.c**: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path in a weighted graph.
8. **prog_8.c**: Generate random integers and sort using user-selected algorithm (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge Sort), with comparison and swap counts.

## Files

- `prog_<q>.c`: C source code for each task.
- `doc_<q>.md`: Documentation for each program.
- `Assignment.md`: Original assignment description.

## How to Run

Compile each C file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc prog_1.c -o prog_1`) and run the executable.
